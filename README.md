# Gaias-Heart

Gaias-Heart This is the project for the contest we are entering We are using unity to report to use when crashes happen, which for now jake is watching over. We have all original art and music along with some lore and a tutorial for the beginning area. We made custom walking animations and a dynamic title screen.
